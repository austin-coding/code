        let age = 28;
        let message = "Hi!";

        // Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:
        let user = 'John',
            age = 28,
            message = 'Hi!';

        //  …Or even in the “comma-first” style:

        let user = 'John'
            , age = 28
            , message = 'Hi!';

        // Technically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it’s a matter of preference.
